Apache module mod_lookup_identity
=================================

Apache module to retrieve additional information about the
authenticated user.

It retrieves the GECOS information using the getpwnam call and store
it in a note/environment variable (by default REMOTE_USER_GECOS).
It gets list of group names the user belongs using getgrouplist and
getgrgid calls and stores it in a note/environment variable (by
default REMOTE_USER_GROUPS, colon separated).

The module needs to be loaded into Apache's configuration file like
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf with directive like

    LoadModule lookup_identity_module modules/mod_lookup_identity.so

The default behaviour can be changed with the following directives:

    LookupOutput where_to_store_results
	
	Specifies if the lookups will be done at all and where the results
	of the lookup will be stored. Possible values are:

	    None: Disable the lookup altogether
	    Notes: Sets the Apache notes table only
	    Env: Sets environment variables only
	    All: Sets both (the default) 

    LookupOutputGECOS name_of_the_note/environment_variable_for_the_GECOS_result

	Default is REMOTE_USER_GECOS

    LookupOutputGroups name_of_the_note/environment_variable_for_the_group_list

	Default is REMOTE_USER_GROUPS

    LookupOutputGroupsSeparator the_separator

	Default is single colon

Of course, if sssd is configured on the machine, it will do the
lookup for us but the standard Unix calls are the interface for us at
this point.

Building from sources
---------------------

When building from sources, command

    apxs -i -a -c mod_lookup_identity.c

should build and install the module.
